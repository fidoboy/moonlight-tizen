# Development Guide

## Repository and dependencies

Clone this repository and initialize the submodules before building:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/fidoboy/moonlight-tizen-ac3.git
cd moonlight-tizen-ac3
```

The current repository has no active Git submodules: the required dependency source trees are committed directly to the repository. A normal clone is sufficient; `git submodule update --init --recursive` is not required.

## Build with Docker

The repository Dockerfile includes the build environment and packages the Tizen widget. From the repository root, build the standard variant:

```bash
docker build --tag moonlight-tizen-ac3:standard --build-arg BUILD_TYPE=release --build-arg REPO_OWNER=fidoboy --build-arg REPO_NAME=moonlight-tizen-ac3 --build-arg FORCE_GAME_MODE=false .
container_id=$(docker create moonlight-tizen-ac3:standard)
docker cp "$container_id:/home/moonlight/Moonlight.wgt" ./Moonlight.wgt
docker rm "$container_id"
```

To build the ForceGM package, repeat the build with `FORCE_GAME_MODE=true` and extract `/home/moonlight/Moonlight-ForceGM.wgt`.

## Continuous integration

The **Build WGT (CI)** workflow validates startup JavaScript, locale consistency and required documentation pages, then builds the standard and ForceGM package variants. It runs on changes to the main branch and on pull requests, and can also be launched manually. CI artifacts are temporary test builds, not versioned public releases.

## Publish a versioned public release

The project uses its own semantic version sequence, starting at **1.0.0**. The Tizen widget version in `res/config.xml` is the source of truth.

1. Update the version in `res/config.xml` (for example, `1.0.1` for the next patch release).
2. Add release notes near the top of `CHANGELOG.md`.
3. Commit and merge the release changes to `master`.
4. Open Actions → **Release WGTs**, run it on `master`, and enter the same version. The workflow validates the version, refuses to overwrite an existing public release, builds both WGT variants and publishes a public GitHub Release tagged `vVERSION`.

Alternatively, push a Git tag such as `v1.0.1` after setting the matching `res/config.xml` version. The same workflow builds the packages and attaches them to the release automatically. Stable releases use the plain semantic version tag; prerelease builds use a `-dev` suffix.

## Audio development notes

Dolby passthrough requires the Tizen client and a compatible experimental Sunshine host. It is optional and must never disable the default OPUS path for hosts that do not offer AC-3/E-AC-3. When testing, verify actual negotiation and output through the TV's intended optical path, not merely the selected setting.

Keep pull requests focused, retain license notices, and document hardware-dependent behavior and test conditions.

Moonlight Tizen is a port of [Moonlight ChromeOS](https://github.com/moonlight-stream/moonlight-chrome), an open-source client for NVIDIA GameStream and [Sunshine](https://app.lizardbyte.dev/Sunshine/). It lets you stream games, applications, and your desktop from a PC to a Samsung Smart TV.

This repository is an **independently maintained project derived from** [Brightcraft's Moonlight Tizen](https://github.com/brightcraft/moonlight-tizen). It builds on Brightcraft's extensive maintenance and development, as well as the earlier work of OneLiberty and the other contributors acknowledged below. It follows its own release series and development roadmap; it is not an official Brightcraft release.

> ## Main purpose: Dolby Digital audio over optical output
>
> The principal reason for this independent project is optional **AC-3 (Dolby Digital) and E-AC-3 (Dolby Digital Plus) passthrough** for compatible Samsung Smart TVs connected over optical (TOSLINK) to a receiver or sound system that supports the selected Dolby format. When the host and playback path support it, the client passes the compressed audio stream to Tizen's native EMSS audio renderer, allowing **stereo or 5.1 surround sound** over a supported optical setup.
>
> - **AC-3 is limited to 5.1 channels.** The current matching experimental Sunshine encoder supports stereo and 5.1; the effective output also depends on the TV model, its audio-output settings, and the receiver or soundbar.
> - **OPUS compatibility is preserved.** Dolby negotiation is optional. If a host only provides OPUS, or does not select AC-3/E-AC-3, Moonlight continues using the normal OPUS path. Hosts that do not implement the optional Dolby extensions remain compatible and do not need to be modified.
> - **Dolby passthrough requires a compatible host.** The matching experimental implementation is available in [fidoboy/Sunshine — ac3-audio](https://github.com/fidoboy/Sunshine/tree/ac3-audio). With a host that only offers OPUS, the client continues to work as usual.
>
> The complete path has been tested with an experimental Sunshine host and Moonlight Tizen on a Samsung TV, including AC-3 and E-AC-3 in default and High Quality audio modes. Results depend on the connected TV and audio equipment.

### Other improvements in this project

- **Audio stream statistics:** shows the negotiated audio codec, channel layout, channel count, and approximate audio bitrate alongside the existing video and performance statistics.
- **Spanish localization:** adds the es-ES locale and translations for the interface, including the new settings and audio statistics.
- **Quit host app on disconnect:** an optional setting requests that the running host application quit after a normal disconnection; unexpected connection failures do not trigger it.
- **Animated native launch screen:** adds an animated Tizen splash screen and its generation script.
- **Settings and input refinements:** improves optical-output settings, their disabled-state presentation and remote navigation, with related keyboard/input refinements.

## 📖 Project history and independent development

This project continues the work of the broader Moonlight Tizen community. The original technical foundation was laid by the [Samsung Developers Forum](https://github.com/SamsungDForum/moonlight-chrome), which demonstrated how Moonlight could run on Tizen by porting the ChromeOS client to WebAssembly, adapting network access, and using the Tizen WASM Player for hardware-accelerated media playback.

The project was then made into a more readily installable Tizen application by [KyroFrCode](https://github.com/KyroFrCode/moonlight-chrome-tizen). Community forks continued to extend it. In particular, [OneLiberty](https://github.com/OneLiberty/moonlight-chrome-tizen) contributed important features such as video codec selection, gamepad mouse emulation, Wake-on-LAN, and IP address input improvements. Other contributors added features including surround-sound configuration, performance statistics, localization, networking support, and additional fixes.

[Brightcraft's dedicated Moonlight Tizen repository](https://github.com/brightcraft/moonlight-tizen) built on that foundation with extensive ongoing work: refactoring the codebase, updating core libraries, resolving long-standing bugs, improving the UI/UX, maintaining the build process, and integrating community contributions. That work made the application more mature and feature-rich, and provides the technical foundation on which this project builds.

The fidoboy/moonlight-tizen project is maintained independently. Its primary focus is optional Dolby Digital / Dolby Digital Plus passthrough for compatible optical audio setups, while preserving the normal OPUS streaming path for hosts that do not support Dolby. The additional features listed above are maintained alongside that core objective. This project preserves attribution to the earlier projects and contributors whose work it builds upon.
